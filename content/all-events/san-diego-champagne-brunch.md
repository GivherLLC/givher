  Join the LGBTQ+ Victory Fund, elected officials, and leaders from San Diego
  and beyond to toast LGBTQ+ political power and support LGBTQ+ candidates.




  At a time when our rights are under attack and our democracy hangs in the balance, LGBTQ+ Victory Fund is fighting back. We are the only national organization working to elect out LGBTQ+ leaders at all levels of government who will stand up for us in the halls of power. Join the movement to recruit, train and support pro-choice LGBTQ+ candidates who will make a difference in our communities.




  Together, we can give LGBTQ+ Americans hope for a future where our lives are respected, our values are represented, and our voices are heard.
