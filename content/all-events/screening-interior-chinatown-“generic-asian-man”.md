eventDescription:
  - paragraph: Based on Charles Yu's award-winning book of the same name, the show
      follows the story of Willis Wu, a background character trapped in a police
      procedural called Black & White. Relegated to the background, Willis goes
      through the motions of his on-screen job, waiting tables and dreaming
      about a whole world beyond Chinatown. When he inadvertently becomes a
      witness to a crime, Willis begins to unravel a criminal web in Chinatown,
      his family's buried history, and what it feels like to be in the
      spotlight.
