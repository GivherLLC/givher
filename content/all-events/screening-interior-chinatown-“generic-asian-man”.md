      to the background, Willis goes through the motions of his on-screen job,
      waiting tables and dreaming about a whole world beyond Chinatown. When he
      inadvertently becomes a witness to a crime, Willis begins to unravel a
      criminal web in Chinatown, his family's buried history, and what it feels
      like to be in the spotlight."
