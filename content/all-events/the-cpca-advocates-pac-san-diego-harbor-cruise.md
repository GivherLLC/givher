  California’s community health centers are the frontline defense for millions, including the workers who power our state.


  When our clinics suffer, our entire economy does.  

  **This isn’t political. It’s personal.**


  Join us aboard a private harbor cruise for an evening of connection, advocacy, and commitment to the future of community health.


  PAC supporters, health center leaders, and change makers will gather for sunset views, curated bites, and meaningful conversation.
